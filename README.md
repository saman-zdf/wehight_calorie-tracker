   - The main things this application will do are it will Get your name, give you an instruction how to use this app, welcome you to this app, the user will have set of options to choose between recording calories, check BMI and see the calories intake record.
     1. if the user chooses to record the calorie intake it will ask the user to enter the type of food ser had, estimated calories, time of the day, and it will calculate the calories intake and display the user how many calories the user had for a day.
     2. if the user chooses to check their BMI, it will ask the user to enter their weight and height and the app will calculate their BMI and will show it to them. if user BMI is in a range of 18.5 â€“ 24.9 user BMI is normal and has a healthy weight, if user's BMI is less than or greater than the range it will tell them how to lose or gain weight by estimation.

   - the reason I'm developing this app is, there are a lot of people suffering from the above issues and they do not know how to manage to reduce or gain weight, this app will help them to do so.
3. identify the target audience
   - my target audience is people who have a weight problem and need to find a solution for their problem by tracking their food intake. and also the future employee that can show off what I can do to develop an application.
4. explain how a member of the target audience will use it
